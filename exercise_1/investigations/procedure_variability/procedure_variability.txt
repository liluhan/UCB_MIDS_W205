It appears that ED_2b (i.e. Admit Decision Time to ED Departure Time for Admitted Patients) has the greatest variability between hospitals. 

This is done by:
1. Group the data from effective_care by measure_ids
2. Compute the range of the score (i.e. MAX - MIN) for each measure_id
	2.1 Some measures have "Not Available" for some hospitals, in this case, this entry is ignored.
3. Sort the measures by their range score in descending order
4. Join with measure_dates to get the actual name of the measure
