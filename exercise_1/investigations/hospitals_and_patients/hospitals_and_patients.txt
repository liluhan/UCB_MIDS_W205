The correlation between average effective_care score and survey responses for all hospitals is approximately -0.25, and the correlation between average readmission
scores and survey responses is approximately -0.15. As such, there is a negative correlation between scores of hospital quality and patient survey. 

This is expected when we inspect the definition of readmission and effective_care:
1. Readmissions scores measures the rate of readmission and deaths, and hence the lower the better;
2. A significant portion of effective_care scores measure either the median time between operations or the rate of patients' condition deteriorating, and it is possible that
this measure is the lower the better.

As a result, a higher score in either area should, and does, correlate with a lower patient survey score. 

The results are obtained by:
1. Compute the average survey score for each hospital;
2. Compute the average effective_care score, and average readmission score for each hospital;
3. Join effective_care score and readmission score (individually) with survey score for each hospital;
4. Run a correlation between the effective_care / readmission score and the corresponding survey score.
